    "# Generate tools dynamically from `treelang` trees\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates how new tools can be created dynamically based on a `treelang` tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a large set of very granular tools at your disposal, say for example, a full toolset of database functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the problems you may wish to solve may be easy to state at a high level but their implementation may be quite complex due to the low level tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cases, once you solve the problem using `treelang` once, you can create a high level tool specific for that high level problem that you can now re-use effectively without needing to infer the underlying tree again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This supports the concept of dynamic MCP servers that can generate and serve tools autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple scenario we simulate a gaming server supporting the following tools (`get_players`, `get_game_stats`, `average`) and try to create a single tool that specifically answers the question: \"compute the average number of hours spent by <some_game> players on the <some_platform> platform\".\n",
