# `treelang`

`treelang` is a Python library that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to enable advanced function calling with Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e. function-calling on steroids! It provides a structured way to represent and evaluate computations, making it ideal for scenarios where complex workflows or nested function calls are required.

## Why `treelang`



## Features

- **Abstract Syntax Tree Representation**: Define computations as ASTs for clarity and modularity.
- **LLM Integration**: Use LLMs (e.g., OpenAI models) to generate and evaluate ASTs.
- **Tool Selection**: Dynamically select tools (functions) available in the system.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the library with custom tools, selectors, and evaluators.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Fully asynchronous design for efficient computation.
